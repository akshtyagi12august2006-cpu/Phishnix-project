# 🛡️ Phishnix - AI-Based Phishing Detection System

Phishnix is a machine learning–powered phishing detection system designed to identify malicious URLs and protect users from online scams. This project leverages supervised learning and real-world datasets to provide accurate, real-time security analysis.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Intelligent Detection:** Uses supervised ML algorithms to classify URLs as safe or malicious.
* **Feature Extraction:** Analyzes lexical and structural features (URL length, symbols, protocols).
* **Web Interface:** A clean, responsive frontend built with Flask.
* **Instant Results:** Optimized model loading via pickle for lightning-fast predictions.
* **Robust Security:** Built-in input validation to handle diverse URL formats safely.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** 3.8 or higher
* **Libraries:**

  * Flask (Web Framework)
  * scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
  * pandas & numpy (Data Processing)
  * pickle (Model Serialization)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshtyagi12august2006-cpu/Phishnix-project.git
cd Phishnix-project
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Application**

```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Access the App**
   Open your browser and navigate to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input:** User enters a URL into the web interface.
2. **Processing:** The `feature.py` script extracts key indicators (e.g., presence of '@', URL depth, HTTPS usage).
3. **Prediction:** The pre-trained model (`newmodel.pkl`) processes these features.
4. **Output:** The system displays whether the site **Legitimate** or a **Phishing threat**.

```python
# Core prediction logic
import pickle

model = pickle.load(open('newmodel.pkl', 'rb'))
prediction = model.predict([url_features])
```
